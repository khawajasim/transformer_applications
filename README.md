# Use of transformer for different applications

##Transformer:

This repository serves as a compilation of my comprehension of the transformer architecture, specifically implementing the concepts outlined in the paper titled "Attention is All You Need" from 2017. Rather than starting from scratch, I've adapted the code from an existing repository available here<https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-transformer>. The implementation is based on Pytorch.

My objective is to explore various applications of the transformer model for personal learning and curiosity. Some of the areas I aim to delve into include:

* Lnguage translation
* Building language models on a mini scale like GPT
* Conducting time-series analysis on instrumental datasets. 

I further intend to use time series analysis for applications in my work on forecasting earthquakes and predicting space weather patterns.

*The repository is still under construction, stay tuned for updates...*

### Transformer for Translation

Here is an application of transformer for German to English translation using a dataset from Hugging face platform.

### Mini GPT
